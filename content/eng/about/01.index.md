# About
 This is the website for the standard dictionaries _Bokmålsordboka_ and _Nynorskordboka_. On 15 April 2024, an upgrade of the site was launched. This new version has better accessibility features than the first version of [ordbøkene.no](https://v1.ordbokene.no/), and it also offers new functions. _Bokmålsordboka_ and _Nynorskordboka_ are two independent, monolingual dictionaries, however, in this version, the user receives suggested translations between Bokmål and Nynorsk based on the word list [_Administrativ ordliste_](https://xn--sprkrdet-c0ac.no/sprakhjelp/Skriverad/Nynorskhjelp/administrativ-ordliste/) from the Language Council of Norway and the machine translation platform Apertium.

_Bokmålsordboka_ and _Nynorskordboka_ are jointly owned by [The Language Council of Norway](https://www.sprakradet.no/) and the [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en). Since 2016, the editorial work on the standard dictionaries has been carried out at the University of Bergen, with several departments involved. [The Norwegian Language Collections](https://www.uib.no/en/ub/spesial/161345/about-norwegian-language-collections) manage the dictionaries and the source material on which they are based. The lexicographers are employed at the [Department of Linguistic, Literary, and Aesthetic Studies](https://www.uib.no/en/lle), and the computer technical work takes place at the [IT division](https://www.uib.no/en/it) and the Norwegian Language Collections at the University of Berggen Library.

The process of revising the content of the dictionaries is ongoing, and the lexicographers regularly publish new and revised word entries. You can read more about this work on [the website of the revision project](https://www.uib.no/lle/revisjonsprosjektet) (only in Norwegian). The role of the Language Council is to ensure the quality of the articles and to determine how words should be written and inflected in Bokmål and Nynorsk. _Bokmålsordboka_ and _Nynorskordboka_ are continuously updated in accordance with the official orthography as prescribed by the Language Council, making them the authoritative source for the current and complete spelling in Bokmål and Nynorsk.
