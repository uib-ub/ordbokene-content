# Using the dictionaries in School
Among Norwegian language dictionaries and word lists, only those approved by the Language Council can be used in teaching and on tests and exams in the Norwegian school system. _Bokmålsordboka_ and _Nynorskordboka_ are among these, and you can find the others on the [Language Council's list of approved resources](https://www.sprakradet.no/sprakhjelp/Skriverad/Ordlister/Ordlister-til-skulebruk/).

ordbøkene.no does not have built-in artificial intelligence and does not contain possible communication channels. The website provides translation suggestions at the word level, but does not offer translations of phrases or entire sentences.

## Dictionaries on restricted exam networks
When schools restrict access to certain websites during tests and exams, a selection of other websites must remain accessible for "ordbøkene.no" to function. Here are the domains used by the dictionary site:

*   [https://ordbokene.no/](https://ordbokene.no/)
*   [https://beta.ordbokene.no/](https://beta.ordbokene.no/)
*   [https://v1.ordbokene.no/](https://v1.ordbokene.no/)
*   [https://oda.uib.no/](https://oda.uib.no/)
*   [https://odd.uib.no/](https://odd.uib.no/)
*   [https://plausible.io/](https://plausible.io/)

## Offline version of ordbøkene.no
Udir recommends that students and private candidates download a version of the relevant dictionaries on the devices to be used on the day of the exam beforehand. Via the website [pwa.ordbok-dev.aws.uib.no](pwa.ordbok-dev.aws.uib.no) you can now download a version of _Bokmålsordboka_ and _Nynorskordboka_, which you can use without an internet connection. This app works in the same way as the website, except that the free text search is not available.

The offline version is intended as a contingency solution for exams and tests, in case there are problems with the internet. The primary solution for schools is to use a restricted exam network.

Note that the offline version is not yet available for mobiles and in the Firefox and Safari browsers. Below we explain how to download the app in Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

### How to download the app in Chrome
You must be connected to the internet to complete the download.

To the right of the address bar in the browser (not in the dictionary) there is a download icon:
The text that appears when you hover over the icon is "Install Dictionaries (PWA)". Click on the icon.

![Alt text](/content-images/Picture1.png)
Click the "Install" button in the popup window.

Wait a couple of minutes for the database with all the dictionary articles to be downloaded and installed. The length of time this takes depends on the network capacity and the device you are using.

The app appears on your taskbar. In some cases, you must allow this first.

Turn off the internet connection, e.g., by activating flight mode, and search as usual.

Check that it says Ordbøkene(PWA) – ordbøkene.no in the upper left corner to make sure you are in the downloaded version and not in the regular online dictionary.

### How to download the app in Chrome
To the right in the address field of the browser (not in the dictionary) there is a download icon:
![Alt text](/content-images/Install_eng.png)

The text that appears when you hover over the icon is "The app is available. Install Dictionaries (PWA)." Click on the icon.

In the next popup window, allow the app to attach itself to the taskbar and start. Optionally uncheck the other options if you wish. Wait a couple of minutes for the database with all the dictionary articles to download. The time it takes depends on the network capacity and the device you are using.

Turn off the internet connection, e.g., by activating airplane mode, and search as usual.

Check that it says Dictionaries(PWA) – ordbøkene.no in the upper left corner to make sure you are in the downloaded version and not in the regular online dictionary.

### Error messages in the app
Do you get error message 500 in the downloaded version? Try clicking on the link "To the homepage" and search again.

Advanced searches may take a little longer than simple searches. If the search hangs up without giving an error message? Go to the homepage by clicking on the text "ordbøkene.no" in the upper left corner or go to a simple search.

Do you get the error message "You are offline"? Try closing the app and reopening it from the taskbar or desktop.

If the app does not work, you can click on the hamburger menu (the three vertical dots) at the top of the page and uninstall the app:

Check to delete data and click "Remove". Go to [pwa.ordbok-dev.aws.uib.no](pwa.ordbok-dev.aws.uib.no) and start over.
